# Simple HTTP API 

## Flask
For this problem we use [FLASK](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) web framework to implement a simple http api. 

## RUN
I wrote a docker-compose for this project so all you need to do is to run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

and the service will be starts.
