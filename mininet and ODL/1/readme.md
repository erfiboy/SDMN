# Mininet and OVS

## [Part 1](./Part1)
In this part we create a simple network with two switch and two host. Then push ovs flows to switches so the host could ping each other.

## [Part2]( ./Part2)
In this part we go further and add a layer 3 router between two switch, so we must push layer 3 flows to switch so the host could ping each other like Part1. For this reason we push arp and ip flow in the router.

## [Part3]( ./Part3)
On this part we provide some flows which is used for set MPLS tags for packets.

## [Part3]( ./Part3-1)
After asking TA if we can add MPLS tags from 31 and 13 this new part implemented.
On this part we provide some flows which is used for set MPLS tags for packets.
